# malware-classification
classification of malware using deep learning  
here we have worked on MalImg dataset , where malwares have been converted into grayscale images.
the code to convert malware to image is also given
from the image we extract only specific region which we flatten it and save it to numpy array ( discussed more on the ppt shared)
the converted csv file is shared here as train-features and test-features 
then we apply cnn and cnn-lstm techniques to classify malware according to their families
